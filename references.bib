  abstract = "The extent of heterogeneity in a meta-analysis partly determines
              the difficulty in drawing overall conclusions. This extent may be
              measured by estimating a between-study variance, but
              interpretation is then specific to a particular treatment effect
              metric. A test for the existence of heterogeneity exists, but
              depends on the number of studies in the meta-analysis. We develop
              measures of the impact of heterogeneity on a meta-analysis, from
              mathematical criteria, that are independent of the number of
              studies and the treatment effect metric. We derive and propose
              three suitable statistics: H is the square root of the chi2
              heterogeneity statistic divided by its degrees of freedom; R is
              the ratio of the standard error of the underlying mean from a
              random effects meta-analysis to the standard error of a fixed
              effect meta-analytic estimate, and I2 is a transformation of (H)
              that describes the proportion of total variation in study
              estimates that is due to heterogeneity. We discuss
              interpretation, interval estimates and other properties of these
              measures and examine them in five example data sets showing
              different amounts of heterogeneity. We conclude that H and I2,
              which can usually be calculated for published meta-analyses, are
              particularly useful summaries of the impact of heterogeneity. One
              or both should be presented in published meta-analyses in
              preference to the test for heterogeneity.",

               tuberculosis (TB). DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE with index terms BCG
               vaccine, tuberculosis, and human. Experts from the Centers for
               Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health
               Organization, among others, provided lists of all known studies.
               STUDY SELECTION: A total of 1264 articles or abstracts were
               reviewed for details on BCG vaccination, concurrent vaccinated
               and unvaccinated groups, and TB outcome; 70 articles were
               reviewed in depth for method of vaccine allocation used to
               create comparable groups, equal surveillance and follow-up for
               recipient and concurrent control groups, and outcome measures of
               TB cases and/or deaths. Fourteen prospective trials and 12
               case-control studies were included in the analysis. DATA
               EXTRACTION: We recorded study design, age range of study
               population, number of patients enrolled, efficacy of vaccine,
               and items to assess the potential for bias in study design and
               diagnosis. At least two readers independently extracted data and
               evaluated validity. DATA SYNTHESIS: The relative risk (RR) or
               odds ratio (OR) of TB provided the measure of vaccine efficacy
               that we analyzed. The protective effect was then computed by
               1-RR or 1-OR. A random-effects model estimated a weighted
               average RR or OR from those provided by the trials or
               case-control studies. In the trials, the RR of TB was 0.49 (95\%
               confidence interval [CI], 0.34 to 0.70) for vaccine recipients
               compared with nonrecipients (protective effect of 51\%). In the
               case-control studies, the OR for TB was 0.50 (95\% CI, 0.39 to
               0.64), or a 50\% protective effect. Seven trials reporting
               tuberculous deaths showed a protective effect from BCG vaccine
               of 71\% (RR, 0.29; 95\% CI, 0.16 to 0.53), and five studies
               reporting on meningitis showed a protective effect from BCG
               vaccine of 64\% (OR, 0.36; 95\% CI, 0.18 to 0.70). Geographic
               latitude of the study site and study validity score explained
               66\% of the heterogeneity among trials in a random-effects
               regression model. CONCLUSION: On average, BCG vaccine
               significantly reduces the risk of TB by 50\%. Protection is
               observed across many populations, study designs, and forms of
               TB. Age at vaccination did not enhance predictiveness of BCG
               efficacy. Protection against tuberculous death, meningitis, and
               disseminated disease is higher than for total TB cases, although
               this result may reflect reduced error in disease classification
               rather than greater BCG efficacy.",
